# HOTEL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
“Hotel Management System”, we have tried to show how the Data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. This has been achieved by dividing the project into various modules. Customer is provided with different services like checking in, checking out, and editing entries or can be advance payments etc. If the customer wants, he/she can cancel his/her booking. Enquiry about any customer or employee can be made either by customer Id or customer name. Enquiry about rooms available can also be made. Our project also includes the module for employee information. It will generate reports for customer, employees (working in the hotel) and Bill for customer is generated when the customer will check out from the hotel. We have included only few modules, as our purpose is to only have the idea or to study about how the management is done in hotels. By adding many more modules this type of project can have scope in various hotels. After going thought the existing system, problem was identified and the scope of development was finalized.
